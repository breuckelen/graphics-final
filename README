# Idea
* Implement a program that generates a planet, including a landscape made using
procedural terrain generation, trees and other plant-like structures using
L systems, and water using triangle meshes.
* Other possible features include dynamic level of detail of the landscape using
tesselation shaders, dependent upon the zoom level of the camera, and perhaps
of the trees and plants as well.

# Implementation

## Procedural Terrain Generation
* We will most likely use an algorithm very similar to the one in the terrain
lab, but applied to a sphere, rather than to a flat plane. We can initially
generate the terrain with a relatively low level-of-detail, as the tesselation
shader will increase the number of vertices within it.

## L Systems
* In order to generate trees, we will use L systems.

## Tesselation Shader
* The tesselation shader will be applied to the terrain and water, dependent
upon the camera zoom, in order to change its level-of-detail.

## Optional features
* Shadow mapping.
* Variable ambient lighting, based on the rotation of the planet.

# Preferred TA
* Carl Olsson
